# Chat App

This project was bootstrapped with [create-expo-app](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/create-a-new-app/) 

To run successfully you would need to specify an api key from [here](https://newsapi.org/docs) in a .env file or as part of your environment variables


```
API_KEY=your_api_key

```
